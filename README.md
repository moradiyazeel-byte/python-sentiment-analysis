# python-sentiment-analysis
Objectives
The primary goal of this task was to apply fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to unstructured text data to extract meaningful insights regarding public opinion or sentiment.

Preprocess Text Data: Implement a robust text cleaning pipeline, including tokenization, stopword removal, and the linguistic reduction technique of lemmatization, to prepare raw text for analysis.

Perform Sentiment Analysis: Use the TextBlob library to compute quantitative sentiment metrics (Polarity and Subjectivity) for each text entry.

Categorize and Visualize Results: Classify the computed polarity scores into qualitative sentiment categories (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and present the distribution and word frequencies clearly using graphical methods.

Tools and Libraries
This project was developed using Python 3.x and relies on the following core libraries:

pandas: For efficient data handling, loading the CSV file, and structuring the processed results.

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): Used extensively for text preprocessing, including Tokenization, Stopword Removal, and Lemmatization.

TextBlob: The primary tool for executing Sentiment Analysis, providing polarity and subjectivity scores.

matplotlib & seaborn: Used to generate the Sentiment Distribution bar chart.

wordcloud: Used to generate the visual representation of Word Frequencies
